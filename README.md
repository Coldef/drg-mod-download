A Python script to obtain a download link for a mod from mod.io. Since game pass version does not support modding like the Steam version,
they have to be installed manually.



To install mods:
Drop the downloaded .pak file in the Paks folder. The path for the Paks folder should look something like this:

C:\XboxGames\Deep Rock Galactic\Content\FSD\Content\Paks
